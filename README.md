MEANapp
=======

Courses to make you a better developer(for better or worse). There aren't any videos. I might make my own videos based on the courses one day 4 laughz and then use the YouTube directive to display them. This was more to understand how the MEAN stack works together. Ostensibly beautified with Bootstrap and with a dab of Stylus.

I'll update this README.md as necessary. http://rst-videos.herokuapp.com
